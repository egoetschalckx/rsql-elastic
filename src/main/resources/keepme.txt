just here to avoid the test to fail as BootstrapForTesting calls checkJarHell.checkJarHell which expects these directories to exist:
- elastic-search-test/build/classes/test/
- elastic-search-test/build/resources/test
- elastic-search-test/build/classes/main
- elastic-search-test/build/resources/main

to get that in gradle, one need to put something in
- src/main/java
- src/main/resources
- src/test/java
- src/test/resources
